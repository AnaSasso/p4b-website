#### Description of the feature
In GOAT, a dataset with a variety of Points-of-Interest (POIs) is already provided by default. If you wish to integrate further POI data sets into GOAT, you can do so via the "Upload" function. A total of 500 MB of storage space is available to each user for this purpose. 

#### Step-by-step instructions for uploading your own Point of Interest data sets

1. Prepare the POI data as a GeoJSON file. If you want to upload multiple POI categories (e.g. youth centres, bikesharing stations), then create a separate file for each category (i.e. in this example a GeoJSON file with the youth centres and a GeoJSON with the bikesharing stations). 

2. Click on "User Data Upload" in the right menu. 

3. Click on the plus symbol.

4. Select the POI category of the dataset. You can either choose one of the predefined categories or create your own.
