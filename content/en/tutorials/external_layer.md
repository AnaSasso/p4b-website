#### Description of the feature

A basemap is a layer that provides geographical context to the map and other dataset layers above it. They provide background details in GIS and help to visualize geographic information more aesthetic way.  

GOAT allows you to work with external background layers with many sources of geographic data. You can customize your analysis with this feature. This can be adjusted by the default layers or add them manually by using "source url".

#### Possible use cases

* For the first example for Munih,you can access the broadband mobile communities 5G from geoportal as external layer.
* In the second example for Freiburg, you can use a topographic basemap for your analyses.


#### Step-by-step tutorials to work with external layers

#### 1) Import the layer from geoportal


1.1) Click on "Other Layers" and click on the "link icon" indicated by the blue box next to the external layer.
