## Growing team
Over the summer, Plan4Better grew to 11 great [team](/en/team "Our team") members. Since our office is based in Munich, we usually only see each other via webcam. Pretty quickly we had the idea to organize a retreat. It is important for us to get to know each other better and to work together on our vision for Plan4Better. With the help of our two Turkish colleagues Dilan and Irem we decided to meet in Side.

## Trip to Turkey

Our trip started on Monday from our different home countries. We finished the first evening with a dinner together in the hotel.

For the week we had planned several working sessions to work on our common visions and strategies.
This is exactly what we did in several workshops during our trip. Working together in sunny Turkey was a bonus!

A big highlight of our retreat was our rafting trip through the Köprülü canyon, followed by a walk through the ancient city of Side. We ended the week with further work sessions before leaving on Friday.
