The 15-Minute City is at the center of the accessibility paradigm in urban planning today. In contrast to traditional planning approach, that tend to expand roads as soon as traffic capacity is exhausted, the 15-Minute City aims to bring residents' everyday needs and destinations closer to them. It's about enabling people to reach their essential facilities and activities within a 15-minute walk, bike ride, or by using public transportation. 


A complex aspect of this concept is considering the individual needs of the population. Since no one has the same daily needs, it is of great importance that urban planners take on an inclusive approach of the diverse groups in society. By understanding and incorporating the needs and circumstances of different population groups, they can create an inclusive and livable 15-Minute City that meets the requirements and desires of all residents. 

## Relationships between Accessibility Components 

Academic discourse discusses four components of accessibility (Geurs & van Wee, 2004): the Land-Use Component, Transport Component, Temporal Component, and the Individual Component. Each of these components plays a crucial role in assessing and analyzing accessibility, allowing for a better understanding of various aspects and influencing factors (K. Geurs and van Wee, 2004). As previously mentioned, a significant challenge in implementing the 15-Minute City and accessibility planning is to adequately consider the individual needs of different "user groups". 

However, the individual component is often overlooked in analyses (Merlin & Jehle, 2023). To enable citizens to conduct personalized accessibility analyses tailored to their needs, we have developed [Map4Citizens](https://citizens.plan4better.de/ "Map4Citizens"). In Map4Citizens, a personalized 15-Minute Score can be calibrated and displayed on an interactive web map. This way, the needs of different user groups can be visualized, and the individual component of accessibility can be illustrated. Map4Citizens can, for instance, assist user groups in locating a suitable residential area tailored to their specific requirements.

## Four User Groups 

Four user groups; the family, the student, the senior, and the childfree couple, were assigned specific needs based on their characteristics. Each user group was associated with a "Mobility Flower", which is based on the weighting of individual Points-of-Interest (POIs). The darker the color, the more important the POIs are for them in that category, and the larger the symbol, the further they are willing to travel to reach the POIs. 


### The Family 

The family values easy access to educational facilities and playgrounds, they occasionally visit cafes but does not have a strong preference for restaurants. They have their own car but find a bus stop close by convenient. Due to time constraints, a gym must be reachable within 10 minutes.

### The Student 

The student, without a car or bike, emphasizes the proximity of bike and car-sharing stations, studies in cafes, and prefers bars over restaurants due to limited finances. He is a vegetarian, with no need for a butcher around the corner, and likes to recycle.

### The Senior 

The senior does not need to be close to schools but would like to be close to playgrounds (for when grandchildren visits). He requires convenient access to public transportation, and the proximity of supermarkets, bakeries, and butchers.

### The Childfree Couple 

The childless couple enjoys going to restaurants and cafes, meets friends in bars on Fridays and has their own means of transportation. They also value the presence of a nearby pharmacy, ATM, bank, gas station, and post office, occasionally visits cinemas and museums, and is willing to travel a bit further.

## 15-Minute Score 

The Mobility Flower generates a 15-minute score, highlighting areas where individual preferences can be best fulfilled.

The two user groups without personal transportation (the student and the senior) have a significantly smaller area in Munich, in which they can live and fulfil their daily needs. It also becomes evident that the fewer specific needs the group has, the higher is the 15-minute score is in multiple neighbourhoods.
