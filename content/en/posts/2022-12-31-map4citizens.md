## Map4Citizens 


In partnership with the [TUM Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/sv/startseite/ "TUM Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning") and [Humankind](https://www.humankind.city/ "Humankind"), we're happy to announce the release of the Beta Version of a new application: [Map4Citizens](https://citizens.plan4better.de/ "Try it out!"). 

Map4Citizens is supported by [EIT Urban Mobility](https://www.eiturbanmobility.eu/), an initiative of the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union. 

Within a 3-month project, we aimed to bridge the gap between citizens and planners, by opening data and providing reliable and easy-understandable urban and mobility analysis to everyone. Our project addressed this by developing a mobile-ready web-based application that allows users to quickly get an overview of important mobility-related parameters in their city and neighbourhood. That's how Map4Citizens was born. 


## Development process 


Starting in October 2022, the project looked into the material gap between the information that planners have at hand and the information that citizens receive and, the cognitive and relevance gap between data and citizens. 

Although numerous cities provide a kind of CitizenGIS to their residents, they usually lack in information about mobility options and local accessibility – which are highly important if we want to foster sustainable mobility.  

In a citizen engagement phase, the workshop’s participants confirmed their interest in better understanding our cities. They are thrilled by the "[15-Min-City](https://www.eiturbanmobility.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/EIT-UrbanMobilityNext9_15-min-City_144dpi.pdf "Learn more about the 15-Min-City Concept")" and want to know how their neighborhood scores.

After studying the citizen's wishes and needs, we carefully developed an application concept and straight away started with the development of the first alpha version. In a usability testing phase, we got highly valuable feedback and plenty of input for a last development sprint. 

Now, are happy to announce that the beta-version is now online for Munich and ready to be used by its citizens: https://citizens.plan4better.de/. 


## Functionalities


The heart of the application is a 15-min-city-score. - tailored on first access, the user picks how long they'd like to reach specific locations, sliding from 5 to 15 minutes.

The Flowers of Proximity methodology was used to assess and codify citizens' relation with accessibility and their interaction with the urban environment. Later on, incorporated into the application as Personal Mobility Flower. 

By applying such methodology, we can meet the different data relevance for the user, and deliver it accordingly. The Flower of Proximity is calculated by the time taken to reach different points of interest. 



Map4Citizen also displays the 15-Minute Score for its cities. Both scores are shown through an interactive gradient. Navigate and interact with your town and neighborhood. Whether you are a city planning pro or a resident, you get to see your region's sustainability with a click. Get to know more about 15 Minute Score and Sustainability. 

## Interested in becoming a pilot partner?

The aim is to develop this beta version further into a multi-functional CitizenGIS, which can be offered to municipalities, counties and other public authorities worldwide as Software-as-a-Service. To shape the application according to the cities wishes and needs, we are currently looking for pilot partners. If you are interested, just [get in contact with us](/en/contact/ "Contact")!
