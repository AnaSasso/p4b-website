## Map4Citizens

In partnership with the [TUM Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/sv/startseite/ "TUM Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning") and [Humankind](https://www.humankind.city/ "Humankind"), we're happy to announce the release of the beta-version of a new application: [Map4Citizens](https://citizens.plan4better.de/ "Try it out!").

Map4Citizens is supported by [EIT Urban Mobility](https://www.eiturbanmobility.eu/), an initiative of the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union.

Within a 3-month project, we aimed to bridge the gap between citizens and planners, by opening data and providing reliable and easy-understandable urban and mobility analysis to everyone. Our project addressed this by developing a mobile-ready web-based application that allows users to quickly get an overview of important mobility-related parameters in their city and neighbourhood. That's how Map4Citizens was born.

## Development process

Starting in October 2022, the project looked into the material gap between the information that planners have at hand and the information that citizens receive and, the cognitive and relevance gap between data and citizens.

Although numerous cities provide a kind of CitizenGIS to their residents, they usually lack in information about mobility options and local accessibility – which are highly important if we want to foster sustainable mobility.

In a citizen engagement phase, the workshop’s participants confirmed their interest in better understanding our cities. They are thrilled by the "[15-Min-City](https://www.eiturbanmobility.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/EIT-UrbanMobilityNext9_15-min-City_144dpi.pdf "Learn more about the 15-Min-City Concept")" and want to know how their neighborhood scores.

After studying the citizen's wishes and needs, we carefully developed an application concept and straight away started with the development of the first alpha version. In a usability testing phase, we got highly valuable feedback and plenty of input for a final development sprint.

Now, are happy to announce that the beta-version is online for Munich and ready to be used by its citizens: https://citizens.plan4better.de/.

## Functionalities

The application is shaped all around the concept of the 15-min-city and comes with multiple functionalities:

* **15-Min-Score:** Tailored on first access, the user picks how long they'd maximum like to travel specific locations. The personalized score shows how well the cities meets those needs.
* **Isochrones:** Calculation of catchment areas with different modes (walking, cycling, transit).
* **POIs:** Visualization of Points-of-Interest (POIs), such as supermarkets, schools and leisure options.
* **Environmental information:** Additional layers such as noise levels, population density, and land use.
* **Public transport quality classes (German:** [**ÖV-Güteklassen**](/en/docs/oev_gueteklasse/)**):** Shows on a city-wide indicator, how good the public transport supply is.

Now it's your turn! How much does your neighborhood fulfill your needs? Whether you are a city planning pro or a resident, you get to see your cities mobility and local accessibility options with a simple [click](https://citizens.plan4better.de/ "Visit Map4Citizens").

## Interested in becoming a pilot partner?

The aim is to develop this beta-version further into a multi-functional CitizenGIS, which can be offered to municipalities, counties and other public authorities worldwide as Software-as-a-Service - and made available to all their citizens. To shape the application according to the cities wishes and needs, we are currently looking for pilot partners. If you are interested, just [get in contact with us](/en/contact/ "Contact")!
