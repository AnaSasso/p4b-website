overview: Statistical evaluations of socio-demographic data and mobility parameters (including MiD) are carried out for three regions (Munich, Aachen and Freiburg) in Germany. These are spatially compared with suitable accessibility indicators in order to show spatial qualities and the attractiveness of the transport system (especially environmental transport). [Thus, accessibilities are calculated especially for pedestrian traffic, bicycle traffic and public transport. With the help of indicators such as heat maps, public transport quality classes and a 15-minute city score, the quality of space and transport is shown in a differentiated manner. The generated analyses are discussed and interpreted in several expert panels and workshops.
