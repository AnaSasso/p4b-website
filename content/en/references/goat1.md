overview: In the context of the GOAT 1.0 development project, the GOAT planning software was developed from a prototype to a mature version 1.0. Both the user interface and a large number of functionalities were refined in the process. The development took place in a co-creative process, in close cooperation with the municipalities of Fürstenfeldbruck, Freising and Munich. During the project, GOAT was used by local planners to evaluate the effects of new path connections and to check the distribution of amenities of daily need.
