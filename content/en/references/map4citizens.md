  - Development of a citizens' GIS on the topic of the 15-minute city

overview: In cooperation with the TUM Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning and Humankind, we developed the citizen GIS "Map4Citizens". The aim of the three-month project was to close the information gap between citizens and planners by opening up data and providing reliable and easy-to-understand mobility analyses for everyone. As part of our project, we developed a mobile-enabled, web-based application that allows users to quickly get an overview of important mobility-related parameters in their city and neighbourhood.
