With GOAT 3.0, analyses with additional means of transport and to new destinations will be made possible, further data will be integrated and the visualisation options will be expanded. To this end, we are working very closely with our project partners - the Technical University of Munich (TUM), the Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development Dresden (IÖR), Prof. Schaller UmweltConsult GmbH (PSU) and Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund GmbH (MVV). 

In more than 20 test and application workshops, the new GOAT functionalities are used and intensively tested for real planning issues together with our practical partners (City of Fürstenfeldbruck, City of Freising, City of Munich, City of Bonn, City of Görlitz, District of Munich, Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region and many more). The feedback obtained in the process is actively incorporated into the further development process and helps us to adapt our tool and its functionality to the needs of the users.
