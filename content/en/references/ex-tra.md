overview: As part of the research project EX-TRA ("Experimenting with city streets to transform urban mobility"), GOAT is being applied to the five cities of Ghent, Amsterdam, London, Bologna and Munich. The planning tool is used by local planners and scientific partners to conduct accessibility and connectivity analyses for active mobility. In this way, weak points in accessibility to important destinations for daily needs can be identified and suitable measures can be defined e.g. in the form of street space experiments. This can be done, for example, by converting parking spaces into play areas for children, placing pop-up shops and food trucks, or greening the street space.

Beyond the planning of street experiments, the accessibility software is used for locally upcoming planning processes. In Amsterdam, for example, the tool is used in the development of the new mobility plan for the Nieuw West district.
