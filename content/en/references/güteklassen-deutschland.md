overview: The aim of the study was to obtain a differentiated overview of public transport accessibility in municipalities under different assumptions. For this purpose, a methodology for the classification of public transport quality classes based on the methodology from Switzerland and Austria was adapted to the study area and the quality classes were calculated for the federal state. At the municipality level, the proportion of the population living in a certain quality class was examined in each case, and the results were visually processed and presented on maps. This made it possible to show deficits in public transport accessibility, which provides important insights for discussing further measures.
