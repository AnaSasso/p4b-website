<b>Zusammenfassung</b>: A wide range of disciplines require population data with high spatial resolution. In particular, accessibility instruments for active mobility need data on the building access level. Data availability varies by context. Spatially detailed national census counts often present the challenge that they are outdated. Therefore, this study proposes a novel approach to hybrid population disaggregation. It updates outdated census tracts and disaggregates population on the building access level. Open and widely available data sets are used. A bottom-up population estimation for new development areas is combined with a top-down dasymetric mapping process to update outdated census tracts. A particular focus lies on the high flexibility of the developed procedure. Accordingly, users can utilize diverse data and adapt settings to a specific study context. Instead of requiring ubiquitous 3D building data, often unavailable free of charge, the approach suggests collecting building levels only in new development areas. The open-source software development was done using PostgreSQL/PostGIS as part of the co-creative development of the accessibility instrument GOAT in three German municipalities. A comparison with reference data from the population registry of one district was realized. On the building level, an R2 of 0.82, and on the grid level (100 m × 100 m), an R2 of 0.89 is reached. The approach stands out when land-use information is outdated; however, a spatially detailed census grid exists, but no ubiquitous 3D building information is available. Enhancements are proposed, such as improving the dasymetric mapping with machine learning and remote sensing techniques. Moreover, more reliable detection of new building development in already built-up areas is suggested to account better for urban densification.

### Accessibility by proximity: Addressing the lack of interactive accessibility instruments for active mobility

<b>Schlüsselwörter</b>: Active mobility; GIS; Open source; Planning support systems

<b>Zusammenfassung</b>: The rise of concepts such as the 15-minute-city represents the growing importance of accessibility by active mobility. In order to promote accessibility, accessibility instruments are developed that have substantial potential to assist practitioners in decision making processes. Therefore, this research starts with an up-to-date overview on the suitability of accessibility instruments when planning for active mobility. It was found that accessibility instruments were significantly further developed in the last few years and there is a rising number of tools that contain novel features. However, it was identified that there is a clear lack of tools specifically designed for modeling active mobility that are open source, include interactive scenario building, and can easily be transferred to new study areas.

Therefore, an interactive accessibility instrument named GOAT (Geo Open Accessibility Tool) was developed, which is open source, transferable, and has an easy-to-use web interface. This instrument has been developed following an iterative software development process in close cooperation with practitioners from three municipalities in the region of Munich, Germany. The practitioners tested the tool independently in numerous workshops in order to provide feedback, which was integrated into the development. Furthermore, the tool was tested and transferred to more than 20 German municipalities, the City of Bogotá (Colombia) and Matosinhos (Portugal). First results show that the collaborative and open development process produced a user-centric solution, which bears the high potential to make planning for active mobility more effective and efficient.
